// An industry seals lorry and taxi.Create a class Automobile that stores production date and price.
// From this class derive another two classes : Lorry, which adds weight capacity in kilogram and Taxi, which adds seat - capacity in number.
// Each of these classes should have member functions to get data and set data.Use user defined constructors to initialize these objects.
