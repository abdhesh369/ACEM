# ACEM Engineering Coursework 🎓

Welcome to the **ACEM (Advanced College of Engineering and Management)** repository. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of academic materials, laboratory exercises, and programming practice throughout the 4-year engineering curriculum.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository is organized by semesters, documenting the progression of technical skills and theoretical knowledge. From fundamental C programming in the early stages to advanced engineering concepts in later semesters, كل (everything) is structured for easy access and reference.
